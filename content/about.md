My name is Devin Graham and I am a [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Public Health with a minor in Biomedical Sciences and a certificate in Public Health Entomology. I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona before moving to College Station, Texas at the age of fourteen where I attended high school and later became a proud member of the fightin’ Texas Aggie class of ‘22 (Whoop!). 

I intend to seek a dynamic and multi-faceted career that blends two of the most powerful and compelling components of our society: science, and policy. This portfolio contains my resume, a collection of writing samples, and a gallery of photographs relevant to my work that are near and dear to my heart.  

I am currently employed as a student assistant for [Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service - Family & Community Health Department](https://fch.tamu.edu/), as well as an Undergraduate Scientist at [Texas A&M Health Science Center - Department of Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology](https://texasmicrobiology.com/), where I assist in the experimentation and research of numerous viral and bacterial biohazardous threat agents. 

My personal interests include reading (I am currently devoting my free time to the many works of acclaimed author and philosopher Ayn Rand), writing, and spending time with my Maltipoo puppy/best friend Poorsha.
