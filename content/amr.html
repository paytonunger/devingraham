<p class="center"><h3>Combating the Rise of Antimicrobial Resistance - 
Incentivizing the Fight Against “Superbugs”</h3></p>

<div class="myDiv">

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Antimicrobial resistance, also known as AMR, describes the adaptation of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi to evolve in such a way that conventional drug therapies, most commonly antibiotics, are no longer sufficient treatments against them. In recent years, there has been a devastating rise in the frequency of such diseases. As traditional drugs become ineffective, countless consequences arise both for the suffering patient, and for the now suffering fields of medicine and healthcare. These daunting antibiotic-resistant bacteria have come to be known colloquially as “superbugs” (McCarthy, 2019).</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The concern surrounding antimicrobial resistance has elevated in recent years as more and more drugs become increasingly powerless when they are needed most. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur each year in the United States, and more than 35,000 people die as a result (“The Biggest Antibiotic-Resistant Threats in the US: 2019 AR Threats Report, 2019). These numbers are constantly rising, and the fields of science, medicine, and healthcare are struggling to keep up with the insidious and quick-learning adaptations of superbugs. The alarming increase in cases of AMR threatens everyone, regardless of whether or not you yourself have an acute infection. As reported by the World Health Organization, the emergence of new resistance mechanisms is spreading globally, threatening our ability to treat infectious diseases and resulting in a myriad of dangers, such as a prolonged need for care, consequential disabilities, and death (“Antimicrobial Resistance, 2018). As infections persist in the body for longer durations of time, the likelihood of spread to others is also increased, amplifying all aforementioned concerns further. The effects of antimicrobial resistance are so far-reaching, that all of global health security is threatened by their continued biological development. Without effective antimicrobials for the prevention and treatment of infections, medical procedures such as organ transplantation, cancer therapies, diabetes management, and routinely performed surgeries will become extremely high risk (“Antimicrobial Resistance”, 2018). Additionally, the increase in antimicrobial resistance strains is so dire to public health that even the advancements of the Millennium Development Goals and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals are endangered (“Antimicrobial Resistance”, 2018) Unless new solutions are attained to combat the growing threat of AMR, the World Bank has estimated that the number of AMR associated deaths could reach 10 million annually by the year 2050 (“No Time To Wait: Securing The Future From Drug-Resistant Infections”, 2019). Dr. Matt McCarthy, an infectious disease specialist, gives his first-hand account in his book Superbugs: The Race to Stop an Epidemic, describing that both “patients and doctors are rightfully terrified” given that “every week [physicians see] patients who are dying of infections that had once been treatable” (McCarthy, 2019).</p>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;To understand the gravity of what antimicrobial resistance means for our society and the future of medicine, one must first understand the basics of bacteria, the history of our fight against them, and how well-known prescription drugs, such as the extraordinary first-ever antibiotic Penicillin, function on a cellular level.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The term “antibiotic” refers to any treatment that either kills or inhibits the growth of a bacteria, and of course, the most celebrated drug of this class is penicillin (“What are Antibiotics and How Do They Work”, 2020). Penicillin functions by bursting bacterial cell walls, resulting in cell death (“What are Antibiotics and How Do They Work”, 2020). As Dr. McCarthy references, the triumph of penicillin streamlined the production of dozens of new antibiotics, fueling what is now known as “the golden era” of antibiotic development, a period that gifted us many of the drugs still in wide use today (McCarthy, 2019). Unfortunately, this victory against bacteria was short-lived. Antibiotic resistance began almost as immediately as the first antibiotics were implemented. It has come to be known that acquired resistance is a result of a combination of “poor prescribing practices by doctors” along with the excessive and uncontrolled use of antibiotics in agriculture, which “exposed bacteria to our precious arsenal of effective drugs, and the microbes quickly figured out ways to neutralize them” (McCarthy, 2019). However, even with the knowledge that antibiotics should be prescribed with caution, they are often a patient’s only means of treatment.</p>

<h4>Deterrents in Continued Antibiotic Developments</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Today, these highly intelligent bacteria remain a step ahead of science, most notably because the progress of science is being impeded in many instances. The answer to our growing problem may seem like a simple one - devote more time and money to the discovery of new antibiotics in order to combat the ever-rising number of lives lost to AMR associated infections. However, this notion is easier said than done. Though many promising novel approaches to combat AMR exist within our ever-evolving scientific community, the incentives to pursue these ideas are lacking. Pharmaceutical research and development happens to have the highest failure rate for new products of any industry, making the creation of a new drug an exceptionally risky endeavor (McCarthy, 2019). In addition to this large margin for failure, there is little motivation for pharmaceutical industries to take the risk because the profits of a new antibiotic pale in comparison to the financial gains of other drugs. Despite the overwhelming need for new and effective antimicrobial treatments, on average, the net percent value of a new antibiotic generates 58 million dollars less than most other drugs a company may produce (McCarthy, 2019).</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The reality is “the pipeline of drugs to treat [antibiotic-resistant bacteria] is always on the verge of drying up” because even if a new safe, and effective antibiotic were to come onto the market, eventually, it too will develop drug resistance; it “is not a matter of if but when” (McCarthy, 2019). While healthcare providers are working to slow the likelihood of acquired resistance, the need for another new drug will never cease. If the status quo is continued and providers are to run out of effective drug therapies while pharmaceutical companies continue to neglect the creation of new antibiotics, millions of lives will be lost and modern medicine would be set back by decades (“What are Antibiotics and How Do They Work”, 2020).</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Given these harsh truths, it is obvious that our capitalist-centric government and our healthcare infrastructure is on the verge of failing us. The question is, what interventions can be taken to remedy this public health crisis?</p>

<h4>Science & Policy Recommendations</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;In order to combat this deadly issue, a combination of public health and public policy approaches must be taken. The following proposals and recommendations are outlined below: an increase in public health education regarding antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic use, an increase in economic incentives to stimulate antibiotic production, and a recommitment to key existing policies.</p>

<h4>Public Health Education to Preserve the Efficacy of Existing Antibacterial Drugs</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The first component in such a strategy is a relatively simple one: an increase in public health education nationwide. Public misconception often contributes to the unfortunate excess of antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. The CDC estimates that roughly half of all prescribed antibiotics written to treat acute respiratory conditions are done so unnecessarily (“Antibiotic Use in Outpatient Settings”, 2017). Many illnesses such as the common cold, seasonal flu, and viral sore throat cannot be treated by means of antibiotics, which many patients are unaware of prior to seeking treatment (“Antibiotic Use in Outpatient Settings”, 2017). It is essential for all individuals to be educated on the drugs they might often request, drugs that are routinely prescribed, and the conditions in which an antibiotic drug is not an appropriate treatment. Oftentimes patients become frustrated when their primary care physician denies them a prescription for their reported illness, and this patient frustration often leads to clinicians being overly-willing to prescribe an antibiotic treatment so their patient feels taken care of, or so that they might maintain adequate patient satisfaction. This dynamic is not only a danger to individual health but community and global health as well.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Another area of concern that could easily be alleviated with increased public health education is the necessity of completing an entire round of antibiotics when prescribed. Patient misuse of antibiotics plays a large role in increased antibiotic resistance. It is not uncommon for ill patients to disregard the final days of their antibiotic prescriptions once they begin to feel better. Not only does completing the required dose prevent the infection from returning, but it is also critical in reducing the risk of the bacteria becoming resistant to the medication in the future.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;While each of these educational goals is minor, physician prescription practices and patient antibiotic misuse make up a large portion of the overarching problem. With increased education regarding prescription safety, not only would the general public gain insight on when and how to best utilize prescriptions, but as a result, fewer people would receive prescriptions in total; many may feel compelled to self-advocate for whether or not they truly need one when visiting the doctor instead of requesting one upfront, knowing the risk an unnecessary round of antibiotics may pose.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;These valuable educational measures should be implemented state-wide throughout respective county public health departments, as well as system-wide for all healthcare institutions such as hospitals, urgent cares, and other locations of clinical medicine. The more readily available this information is, especially at locations in which individuals most frequently receive care, the more knowledgeable patients will be on how to help themselves and their community slow the emergence of antimicrobial resistance on a grander scale.</p>

<h4>Economic Incentives for the Creation of New Antibiotics</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The greatest obstacle regarding AMR and the future of multidrug resistance lies within the pharmaceutical industry. As mentioned previously, the combination of high costs, high risk, and little financial gain are overwhelming disincentives for pharmaceutical companies to commit to the exploration of potential new antibiotics. Of course, science and policy are intrinsically linked, and thus the best way to fuel private interest in such projects is to implement a combination of several economic incentives.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Firstly, a financial incentive in the form of tax credits. Tax credits are established to “reduce the amount of money a manufacturer owes the government in the form of tax liability”, which would “offset research and development expenditures” substantially (Casey, Casey, Catron, Kirkpatrick, Nickelson, Snavely, Segundo, Thomas, 2019 ). Such credits compensate for the high-costs of antibiotic production, motivating companies to explore novel approaches under lower-risk conditions. In addition to tax credits, a market entry reward (MER), or financially valuable prize given to a manufacturer at the time that their qualifying drug enters the market, would also invigorate antimicrobial drug production (Daniel, Lopez, McClellan, Schneider, 2018). A market entry reward “aims to create an attractive market for investment” in antibiotic research and development (Ardal, Cameli, Findlay, Gyssens, Laxminarayan, Outterson, Rex, Savix, 2018). The Driving Reinvestment in Research and Development and Responsible Antibiotic Use Program, known as DRIVE-AB, has projected that “a market entry reward of one billion dollars per antibiotic globally (in addition to unit sales revenues) could quadruple the number of new antibiotics coming to the market in the next 30 years” (Ardal, Cameli, Findlay, Gyssens, Laxminarayan, Outterson, Rex, Savix, 2018). Such an infusion of new and effective antimicrobial treatments would re-invigorate scientific research for the field of medicine, inspiring a second golden era of antibiotic production.</p>

<h4>Review of Existing Policy</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Executive Order 13676, signed into law in 2014 under President Obama, initiated the creation of the Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. Released in conjunction with Executive Order 13676 was the U.S. National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. Part of the many goals of these commitments to AMR reduction was to respond to current outbreaks, and prevent future ones by “promoting new and next-generation antibiotics and diagnostics” (Executive Order No. 13676, 2014). The signing of this order and the release of a national strategy to combat AMR was a significant step in the right direction. As stated in the report, the Task Force “shall describe steps that agencies can take to encourage the development of new and next-generation antibacterial drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and novel therapeutics” as well as create a 5-year action plan for the government sector (Executive Order No. 13676, 2014). While such an act of legislation is essential in improving the pipeline of new antimicrobial drugs, it is essential that these priorities remain at the forefront of public health and in the minds of our government leaders and policymakers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Since the birth of the U.S. National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, the CDC awarded forty million dollars in first innovation funding to academic, industry, and healthcare investigators, the U.S. government launched a year-long campaign known as “The AMR Challenge”, lead by the CDC, to encourage global organizations to make formal commitments that further the progress against resistance, and concluded “The AMR Challenge” in 2019 with more than 350 partner commitments worldwide (“U.S. Action to Combat Antibiotic Resistance”, 2019). It is imperative that all necessary fields maintain this commitment and further perpetuate these goals throughout the coming years.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance is one that cannot be ignored. While one “golden era” of antibiotic production has passed, it is essential that we as a global health community focus all necessary efforts on inspiring another period of rapid innovation. Through a combination of science and policy, the threat of AMR can and will be reduced, if urgency is taken. The above mentioned economic incentives, in combination with widespread measures of public health education, would replenish the weaning pipeline of antimicrobial drugs on the market, while simultaneously diminishing the emergence of new antimicrobial resistance.</p>
